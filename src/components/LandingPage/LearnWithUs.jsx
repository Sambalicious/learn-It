                <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600"> January this year, i made a resolution to learn software development because i had always wanted to do that for a long time.
                    A friend of mine introduced me too Learn-It and ever since then, i have learnt so much from their incredible instructors. i just got a job at Venture Garden Group as a Frontend Engineer. 
                </p>
